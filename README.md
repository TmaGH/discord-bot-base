Developing a basic discord bot base with Python and Discord.py API wrapper (https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

So far most work has gone into making it retrieve video data from YouTube with the YouTube API and play the sound of YouTube videos in a voice channel.

Currently experiencing some problems (API is changing rapidly and this hasn't been updated for a while).
